There are two forms, the anadromous form known as the sockeye and the landlocked form (with a much smaller maximum size) known as the kokanee (Ref. 27547).  Upon emergence from gravel, fry at first tends to avoid light, hiding during the day and emerging at night (Ref. 27547).  In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).  With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).

In some areas such as Shark Bay and the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, adults live in marine waters throughout the year.  This behaviour seems to occur only where estuarine and freshwater habitats are limited (Ref. 28722).  A small proportion (probably about 5%) (Ref. 28722) of older juveniles may leave the estuaries and migrate along the beaches in early summer.  The migration may be associated with flooding of rivers and is referred to as the 'hardgut' migration because the mullets' guts are empty (Ref. 28722).  Migrating sea mullet do not feed during either the 'hardgut' migration or spawning migration (Ref. 6390).  Feed on zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, microalgae, and detritus (Ref. 11889).  Undergo ontogenic shift in diet (Ref. 41769).  Small mullet (< 4 cm SL) feed exclusively on sediment by browsing.  Large mullet (< 4 cm SL) have been observed to feed by grazing on the sediment (Ref. 41769).  Changes in the feeding habits from planktonic organisms and migratory zooplankton to meiobenthos which takes place between 0.1 and 0.2 cm length, and a switch from meiobenthos to microbenthos between 0.15 and 0.25 cm length (Ref. 56101).  Sea mullet normally feed close to the river bed in shallow water, but do move throughout the water column in river channels and individuals often jump high out of the water (Ref. 6390).  Sea mullet have a strong tendency to school as juveniles and during the spawning season as adults.  Feeding schools of juveniles commonly disperse over sand and mud flats of estuaries during high tide and reform on the ebb tide (Ref. 28722).  Presence of sharp pointed teeth  that enable the species to select fine material (Ref. 74863).

In southwestern Australia, <i>Mugil cephalus</i> is a dominant finfish in the middle and upper estuaries especially in winter and spring - up to 95% of frequency of occurrence (Lonengan & Potter 1990).  Has a short, well-defined juvenile recruitment period; although found in freshwater, occurs in far greater numbers in all areas of estuaries and is common in the sea (Ref. 74748, 74749).  Gill-raker filaments were found in the stomach captured using gill net.  Mullets struggle to be free of the constricting meshes, food is often regurgitated at an early stage, subsequent gasping of oxygen would then easily cause gill-rakers, broken loose in the struggle, to be swalowed (Ref. 74739).

The electric organ of this species consists of flattened electrocytes, numbering to about hundreds of thousands, connected in series (Ref. 10840; 10011).  Generates two type of electric organ discharges (EODs) from different electric organs which are of myogenic derivation:  1) low-voltage EODs (about 10 V) emitted by the Sach's organ at rates of up to 25 Hz, and 2) high-voltage EODs (about 50-fold) emitted by the main and Hunter's organs at peak rates of up to several hundred Hz.  Low-voltage EOD has been associated with electro location whereas high-voltage EOD has been noted during predatory attacks (Ref. 10011).  An EOD of 500 V was recorded from a 1 m specimen (Ref. 10530), making it a potentially dangerous species.  Incorporation of this species in fish-based house security systems has been suggested (see Ref. 9506).

The species evidently moves from deeper water into shallow beaches at night when seine nets intercept much larger numbers of this species. It is also found in the well oxygenated paraná channels that wind through the whitewater várzea floodplain flanking major whitewater rivers such as the Rio Solimões. However, at high water paraná channels fill with hypoxic water emanating from adjacent flooded forests, and all species of <i>Rhabdolichops</i>, along with other riverine gymnotiforms, migrate out into the main river channels.  Small numbers of this species were found in the lower reaches of Lago Tefé, a blackwater lake containing low-conductivity water.  The preferred habitat of this species is turbid river water with electrical conductivity in the range of 80-150 µScm-1.  There in no information about the breeding habits of this species.  Mature males and females were found during the rising water phase of the Amazon River and were encountered among many other immature specimens on beaches.
