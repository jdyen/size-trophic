### Size-based models of trophic position in freshwater fishes 

This repository contains supporting information for Kopf et al. (in revision) Global patterns and predictors of trophic position in freshwater fishes.

The `code` directory contains all scripts used to fit the statistical models presented in Kopf et al., as well as scripts to summarise fitted models. Data are partially included but trait data are currently under embargo.
